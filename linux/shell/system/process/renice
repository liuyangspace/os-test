info: 改变一个正在进行的进程的优先级

use:
    renice n pid    //优先级取值范围为(-20,19)默认是0  值越小，权越大
                      ps -le 中，NI就是优先级

--help

    Usage:
     renice [-n] <priority> [-p|--pid] <pid>...
     renice [-n] <priority>  -g|--pgrp <pgid>...
     renice [-n] <priority>  -u|--user <user>...

    Options:
     -g, --pgrp <id>        interpret argument as process group ID
     -n, --priority <num>   specify the nice increment value
     -p, --pid <id>         interpret argument as process ID (default)
     -u, --user <name|id>   interpret argument as username or user ID
     -h, --help             display help text and exit
     -V, --version          display version information and exit

    NAME
           renice - alter priority of running processes

    SYNOPSIS
           renice [-n] priority [-gpu] identifier...

    DESCRIPTION
           renice  alters  the  scheduling  priority  of  one or more running processes.  The first argument is the priority
           value to be used.  The other arguments are interpreted as process IDs (by default), process group IDs, user IDs,
           or user names.  renice'ing a process group causes all processes in the process group to have their scheduling
           priority altered.  renice'ing a user causes all  processes owned by the user to have their scheduling priority altered.

    OPTIONS
           -n, --priority priority
                  Specify the scheduling priority to be used for the process, process group, or user.  Use of the option -n
                  or --priority is optional, but when used it must be the first argument.

           -g, --pgrp pgid...
                  Force the succeeding arguments to be interpreted as process group IDs.

           -u, --user name_or_uid...
                  Force the succeeding arguments to be interpreted as usernames or UIDs.

           -p, --pid pid...
                  Force the succeeding arguments to be interpreted as process IDs (the default).

           -h, --help
                  Display a help text.

           -V, --version
                  Display version information.
    EXAMPLES
           The following command would change the priority of the processes with PIDs 987 and 32, plus all processes owned
           by the users daemon and root:

                  renice +1 987 -u daemon root -p 32

    NOTES
           Users  other  than  the  super-user  may  only  alter  the  priority  of  processes  they  own, and can only
           monotonically increase their ``nice value'' (for security reasons) within the range 0 to PRIO_MAX (20), unless
           a nice resource limit is set (Linux 2.6.12 and higher).  The super-user may alter the priority of any process
           and set the priority to any value in the range PRIO_MIN (-20)  to PRIO_MAX.  Useful priorities are: 20 (the
           affected processes will run only when nothing else in the system wants to), 0 (the ``base'' scheduling priority),
           anything negative (to make things go very fast).

    FILES
           /etc/passwd
                  to map user names to user IDs

    SEE ALSO
           getpriority(2), setpriority(2)

    BUGS
           Non super-users can not increase scheduling priorities of their own processes, even if they were the ones that
           decreased the priorities in the first place.

           The Linux kernel (at least version 2.0.0) and linux libc (at least version 5.2.18) does not agree entirely on
           what the specifics of the systemcall interface to set  nice  values  is.   Thus  causes renice to report bogus
           previous nice values.

    HISTORY
           The renice command appeared in 4.0BSD.

    AVAILABILITY
           The renice command is part of the util-linux package and is available from Linux Kernel Archive ⟨ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/⟩.
