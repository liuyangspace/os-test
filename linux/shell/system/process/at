    NAME
           at, batch, atq, atrm - queue, examine or delete jobs for later execution

    SYNOPSIS
           at [-V] [-q queue] [-f file] [-mMlv] timespec...
           at [-V] [-q queue] [-f file] [-mMkv] [-t time]
           at -c job [job...]
           atq [-V] [-q queue]
           at [-rd] job [job...]
           atrm [-V] job [job...]
           batch
           at -b

    DESCRIPTION
           at and batch read commands from standard input or a specified file which are to be executed at a later time,
                    using /bin/sh.
           at      executes commands at a specified time.
           atq     lists  the  user's  pending jobs, unless the user is the superuser; in that case, everybody's jobs are listed.
                    The format of the output lines (one for each job) is: Job number, date, hour, queue, and username.
           atrm    deletes jobs, identified by their job number.
           batch   executes commands when system load levels permit; in other words, when the load average drops below 0.8,
                    or the value specified in the invocation of atd.
           At allows fairly complex time specifications, extending the POSIX.2 standard.  It accepts times of the form HH:MM to
           run a job at a specific time of day.  (If that time is already  past,  the  next day  is  assumed.)  You may also
           specify midnight, noon, or teatime (4pm) and you can have a time-of-day suffixed with AM or PM for running in the
           morning or the evening.  You can also say what day the job will be run, by giving a date in the form month-name day
           with an optional year, or giving a date of the form MMDD[CC]YY, MM/DD/[CC]YY, DD.MM.[CC]YY or [CC]YY-MM-DD.  The
           specification of  a date  must  follow  the specification of the time of day.  You can also give times like now +
           count time-units, where the time-units can be minutes, hours, days, or weeks and you can tell at to run the job today
           by suffixing the time with today and to run the job tomorrow by suffixing the time with tomorrow.
           For example, to run a job at 4pm three days from now, you would do at 4pm + 3 days, to run a job at 10:00am on
           July 31, you would do at 10am Jul 31 and to run a job at 1am  tomorrow, you would do at 1am tomorrow.

           The exact definition of the time specification can be found in /usr/share/doc/at-3.1.10/timespec.

           For  both at and batch, commands are read from standard input or the file specified with the -f option and
           executed.  The working directory, the environment (except for the variables TERM, DISPLAY and _) and the umask
           are retained from the time of invocation.  An at - or batch - command invoked from a su(1) shell will retain
           the current userid.  The user will  be mailed  standard error and standard output from his commands, if any.
           Mail will be sent using the command /usr/sbin/sendmail.  If at is executed from a su(1) shell, the owner of the
           login shell will receive the mail.

           The superuser may use these commands in any case.  For other users, permission to use at is determined by the
           files /etc/at.allow and /etc/at.deny.

           If the file /etc/at.allow exists, only usernames mentioned in it are allowed to use at.

           If /etc/at.allow does not exist, /etc/at.deny is checked, every username not mentioned in it is then allowed
           to use at.

           If neither exists, only the superuser is allowed use of at.

           An empty /etc/at.deny means that every user is allowed use these commands, this is the default configuration.
    OPTIONS
           -V      prints the version number to standard error.

           -q queue
                   uses the specified queue.  A queue designation consists of a single letter; valid queue designations range
                   from a to z.  and A to Z.  The a queue is the default  for  at  and the b queue for batch.  Queues with
                   higher letters run with increased niceness.  The special queue "=" is reserved for jobs which are currently
                   running.

           If a job is submitted to a queue designated with an uppercase letter, the job is treated as if it were submitted
           to batch at the time of the job.  Once the time is reached, the batch processing rules with respect to load average
           apply.  If atq is given a specific queue, it will only show jobs pending in that queue.

           -m      Send mail to the user when the job has completed even if there was no output.

           -M      Never send mail to the user.

           -f file Reads the job from file rather than standard input.

           -l      Is an alias for atq.

           -r      Is an alias for atrm.

           -d      Is an alias for atrm.

           -v      Shows the time the job will be executed before reading the job.

           Times displayed will be in the format "Thu Feb 20 14:50:00 1997".

           -c     cats the jobs listed on the command line to standard output.

           -t time_arg
                  Submit the job to be run at the time specified by the time_arg option argument, which must have the same
                  format as specified for the touch(1) utility’s -t  time  option argument ([[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm).

    ENVIRONMENT
           SHELL   The  value  of the SHELL environment variable at the time of at invocation will determine which shell is
                   used to execute the at job commands. If SHELL is unset when at is invoked, the user’s login shell will be
                   used; otherwise, if SHELL is set when at is invoked, it must contain the path of a shell interpreter
                   executable that will be used to run the commands at the specified time.

           at will record the values of environment variables present at time of at invocation. When the commands are run at
           the  specified time, at will restore these variables to their recorded values .  These variables are excluded from
           this processing and are never set by at when the commands are run :
           TERM, DISPLAY, SHELLOPTS, _, PPID, BASH_VERSINFO, EUID, UID, GROUPS.
           If the user submitting the at job is not the super-user, variables that alter the behaviour of the loader ld.so(8),
           such as LD_LIBRARY_PATH , cannot be recorded  and  restored by at .

    FILES
           /var/spool/at
           /var/spool/at/spool
           /proc/loadavg
           /var/run/utmp
           /etc/at.allow
           /etc/at.deny

    SEE ALSO
           cron(1), nice(1), sh(1), umask(2), atd(8).

    BUGS
           The correct operation of batch for Linux depends on the presence of a proc- type directory mounted on /proc.

           If  the  file  /var/run/utmp  is not available or corrupted, or if the user is not logged on at the time at is
           invoked, the mail is sent to the userid found in the environment variable LOGNAME.  If that is undefined or empty,
           the current userid is assumed.

           At and batch as presently implemented are not suitable when users are competing for resources.  If this is the case
           for your site, you might want  to  consider  another  batch system, such as nqs.
